## 6. 最佳實踐與技巧

### 6.1 元標籤使用技巧
- **保持簡潔：** 每個部分使用 1-3 個描述詞
- **關鍵標籤前置：** 前 20-30 個詞最重要
- **避免過載：** 最多 2-3 種樂器
- **具體化：** "西班牙尼龍吉他琶音" 優於 "吉他"
- **使用區塊定義：** 為主歌/副歌/橋段定義不同的氛圍
- **實驗：** 標籤可能需要 2-3 次生成才能穩定生效

### 6.2 風格公式使用技巧
- **具體但簡潔：** 每個部分最多 1-2 行
- **使用生動的描述詞：** "霓虹燈閃爍的東京街道" 優於 "夜晚的城市"
- **務必包含即興詞 (Ad-libs)：** 定義人聲的個性和真實感
- **結構很重要：** 使用箭頭 (→) 清晰展示歌曲流程
- **混音部分是關鍵：** 這是製作魔法發生的地方
- **不要過載：** 樂器部分最多 4-6 種樂器
- **BPM 指導一切：** 務必在曲風行中包含 BPM

### 6.3 成功率預期
- 簡單請求：70-90% 成功率
- 複雜效果：30-60% 成功率
- 極端實驗：10-40% 成功率
- 複雜曲目至少需預算 3-10 次生成

### 6.4 快速修復
- **AI 忽略指令？** → 在風格和歌詞中都提及，嘗試 5 次以上
- **聲音混濁？** → 將效果減少到最多 3-4 個
- **長提示詞被忽略？** → 簡化為核心元素

### 6.5 曲風變化技巧
- **使用節奏註釋：** 明確標示 BPM 變化
  ```
  [VERSE - 78 BPM FOLK]
  [PRE-DROP - TEMPO INCREASING TO 140 BPM]
  [DROP - 140 BPM DUBSTEP]
  ```
- **創建過渡區段：**
  ```
  [TRANSITION - ACOUSTIC FADING, GLITCH ELEMENTS EMERGING, TENSION BUILDING]
  [FILTER SWEEP, WHITE NOISE RISER, DRUMS INTENSIFYING]
  ```
- **使用對比描述詞：**
  ```
  [WARM ORGANIC ACOUSTIC] → [COLD DIGITAL AGGRESSIVE ELECTRONIC]
  [INTIMATE BREATHY VOCALS] → [DISTORTED ROBOTIC SCREAMING]
  ```
- **用音效標示重大轉變：**
  ```
  [RECORD SCRATCH], [DIGITAL GLITCH], [SUDDEN SILENCE], [EXPLOSION SOUND EFFECT]
  ```
